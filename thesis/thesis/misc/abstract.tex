Humans perceive the visual world through a process of selective attention, 
allowing them to focus high resolution vision on relevant parts of a scene and integrate that information across time.
This thesis aims to model this process of visual attention with artificial agents, enabling them to efficiently process visual information in complex environments.
I propose a novel (can i write novel here? it feels fancy but not sure) architecture that combines a recurrent visual attention mechanism with reinforcement learning to allow agents to learn where to look in order to maximize task performance.
An auxiliary decoder helps to stabilize latent memory representations and enables interpretability of the current memory state.
I evaluate the proposed architecture on a set of challenging visual tasks, including maze navigation, ... .
