Humans perceive the visual world through a process of selective attention, 
allowing them to focus high resolution vision on relevant parts of a scene and integrate that information across time.
This thesis aims to model this process of visual attention with artificial agents, enabling them to efficiently process visual information in complex environments.
We propose a novel architecture that combines a recurrent visual attention mechanism with reinforcement learning to allow agents to learn where to look in order to maximize task performance.
An auxiliary decoder helps to stabilize latent memory representations and enables interpretability of the current memory state.
We evaluate the proposed architecture on a set of challenging visual reasoning tasks, demonstrating its ability to learn effective attention policies.
The aim of this thesis is to lay the groundwork for future research in active vision and reinforcement learning, providing a modular and extensible framework for exploring these ideas further.
