The Html sketch and Readme was basically entirely made by Claude (With some small changes by me)

The Expose was written by me (As seen in the pre Ai file) and then i did the phrasing and visuals with ChatGPT (Proof-read obviously though)
Right now the network graphic is also generated by ChatGPT. I will create my own one when i get my adobe license approved.

Copilot completion recommendations are active throughout the entire coding process.
This is only for convenience, it doesnt create ideas it just helps writing the code.
